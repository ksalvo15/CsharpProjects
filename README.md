# Blackjack
This is my Blackjack project where it takes user input in a console app to calulate bets and total bank amount in a blackjack game. once it has taken the user input it then generates random cards to the player where they can hit or stay based off the cards

# Car Insurance
This is an MVC project that takes user input and calculates a quote based off the user informaiton. There is an admin page that shows all the insurees and their quotes.

# Mini Assignments
these are the mini assignments that I have uploaded to github throught the course.
